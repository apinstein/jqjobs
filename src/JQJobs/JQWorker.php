     * @param object JQStore The backing store to use to get/save jobs.
     * @param array Options:
     *              - queueName (string): which queue to pull jobs from; ALL queues by default.
     *              - wakeupEvery (int): the worker sleeps if there are no jobs; it will wake up every N seconds to poll for new jobs.
     *              - verbose (boolean): Output information about each job being run.
     *              - guaranteeMemoryForJob (int): The worker will exit if there is not at least this much memory available before running the next job.
     *                                             Since the worker is usually managed by a process supervisor that will restart it when it dies,
     *                                             this preventative measure effectively eliminates OOM's while jobs are running, which leave
     *                                             an orphaned "running" job. This is a highly undesireable state.
     *                                             DEFAULT: will require 20% of memory limit still available.
     *              - exitIfNoJobs (boolean): Should the worker exit if no jobs remain. DEFAULT: false.
     *              - exitIfNoJobsCount (int): if exitIfNoJobs is enabled, how many "no jobs" responses are allowed before exiting. DEFAULT 1.
     *              - exitAfterNJobs (int): The worker will exit after N jobs have been processed. Set to NULL to run forever. DEFAULT: NULL.
     *              - adjustPriority (int): An integer value used to adjust the priority (see proc_nice). Postive integers reduce priority. Negative integers increase priority (requires root).
     *                                      A adjustPriority of 10 is reasonable for background processes.
     *              - gracefulShutdownTimeout (int): Number of seconds to allow jobs to finish before killing them forcefully. DEFAULT: 5.
     *              - enableJitter (boolean): Intruduces slight time jitter on start and sleep to prevent accidental DOS/resonance in high-concurrency situations
