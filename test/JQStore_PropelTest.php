     * OK here's the situation
     *
     * Our signal processing stuff is supposed to prevent jobs from being hung in a RUNNING state.
     *
     * The way this works is that essentially anytime a job is INTERRUPTED un-gracefully, we will just pretend that the job never ran.
     * Since it's marked as RUNNING in the DB, this means that we need to update the DB to show it as QUEUED (mulligan retry).
     *
     * Here's where it gets really ugly. If the signal fires after the data has been applied to the Propel instance, but before it's committed to the DB,
     * then it's possible for the software model to be differnt from the DB model in a way that makes the graceful signal handler think that the job's status
     * was successfully reported to the DB when it wasn't. 
     *
     * So the graceful signal handler needs to be sure to know what the DB thinks, and to re-queue the job if it's checked out as running.
     *
     * If propel's instance cache is hit for the job, then you risk the problem that the data from the "get job from DB" will be the not-yet-persisted status
     * which would foil the check described above from working. This test just ensures that this isn't broken.
