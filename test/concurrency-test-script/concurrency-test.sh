# This script is a test rig for concurrent insertion of jobs and concurrent worker execution.
# It also helps test the locking to be sure the queue is uninterrupted by pg_dump (backup).
# To play with different lock modes, see JQStore_Propel::next()
#
# POSTGRES TUNING: (samples below are tested on OS X)
#
# Typical installs of PG don't have enough connections to do high concurrency. Try editing postgresql.conf:
# max_connections = 200
#
# Then restart postgres (port unload postgresql91-server; port load postgresql91-server)
#
# You will likely need to bump shared memory for that to work
# sysctl -w kern.sysv.shmmax=16777216 kern.sysv.shmall=8192
# sysctl -h kern.sysv

# debugging aids
# set -e # stop on error -- if your script stops unceremoniously, don't forget this is here!
# set -x # print each statement before running
