# This script is a test rig for concurrent insertion of jobs and concurrent worker execution.
# It also helps test the locking to be sure the queue is uninterrupted by pg_dump (backup).
# To play with different lock modes, see JQStore_Propel::next()

set -e # stop on error
# set -x # print each statement before running
